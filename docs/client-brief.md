# Client Brief

## Value Proposition

This Address Books application provides a digital solution to the storage of individual's unique details such as name,
email and phone number. Future-proof your list of contact details as your storage won't run out unlike a physical book
with limited pages. The search function allows quick access to any of your contacts.

### User Benefits

A traditional physical address book has limited space, whereas DFCorp's latest offering will scale indefinitely as your
list of contacts grows over time. You're able to quickly find the individual's details by entering a name into the
search function.

### Business Impacts

Having a digital address book for your business will help increase overall productivity and reliability that can extend
to a better experience for your customers. Imagine having your customer's details available at the press of a button
when they unexpectedly call or arrive at your store instead of having to rifle through a book or stack of papers. By
having rapid access to their details, you've made a positive impression on the customer and can quickly focus onto
assisting them, thus providing better service and helping retain them as a future customer.
